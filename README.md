## 👉 Get started

The **TypeScript SDK** is fully open source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fulfillmenttools/fulfillmenttools-sdk-typescript).
The package is published on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fulfillmenttools/fulfillmenttools-sdk-typescript).
It contains both an ESM and a CommonJS build, so you can use it in the browser and in the backend.
You can install it with the command below:

```bash
npm install @fulfillmenttools/fulfillmenttools-sdk-typescript

// or

yarn add @fulfillmenttools/fulfillmenttools-sdk-typescript
```
